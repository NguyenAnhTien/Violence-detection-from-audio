Detection of violence from media by analyzing audio streams

Abstract

In the context of present day scenario, where multimedia data is proliferating at an exponential rate, it is getting increasingly important to automate the monitoring of the content. Manual inspection for the censoring of sensitive content takes a toll when thousands of files require constant assessment. The need to protect certain social groups has given rise to the need for massive content filtering systems which focus on certain aspects of media like, violence. In this paper, we propose a model wherein the violent scenes are detected from audio after learning representations of audio features.
